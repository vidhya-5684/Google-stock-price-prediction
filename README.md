# Google-stock-price-prediction
Forecasting Google stock price using RNN and LSTM deep learning algorithm.


This project aimed to forecast the stock price of Google. For the forecasting, we deployed RNN and LSTM with different hyperparameter tuning. The RNN model with 100 cell numbers and 100 epochs and LSTM model predicted with better accuracy. Since LSTM needs more computational power, a simple RNN is most suitable for future predictions.
